# Chatting_APP_HTML-CSS-BOOTSTRAP-JAVASCRIPT-PHP-MYSQL-
In this project, I've demonstrated how to use HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, PHP with MySQL, and JavaScript to build a complete chat application. If you're a new user of this chat app, you must first sign up before being brought to the users area page, where users just like you who have signed up for this chat app will appear there with their complete names, profile images, active statuses, and other information.

                                 Project Details:
When you first launch this chat project in your browser, a signup form is displayed, requiring you to enter your name, email, password, and avatar. You can only enter a valid email address and an image file because the email and image fields are thoroughly validated. After successfully registering, you will be routed to the user's page, where you can see your complete name, image, status, and logout button at the top. If anyone else has registered, users similar to you will appear at the bottom.

n view their picture, name, status, and any recent messages they have sent to you on this page. You must click on the specific user, or you may use the search bar to look up any existing user by name, in order to be sent to the chat page, where you can view the individual's image, name, and status.

As soon as you send a message to another user, both your chat box and the recipient's chat box immediately display the message. This user saw the message and sender image in the chatbox for the message receiver. As soon as the chatbox starts scrolling, keep in mind that it will go automatically to the bottom. You can log out of the chat program at any moment, and once you do, everyone else will know that you have done so and are now offline.

You can log back in using the email address and password you used to register for the form after logging out. If you supplied the correct information, you will be forwarded to the user's page and everyone else will be able to see that you have logged on and are now active.
